# RO-Stat-Calculator
Short project to practice web development.  
  
A stat calculator for Ragnarok Online, to help distribute points according to levels.

How to use this calculator:  
- Open index.html, the calculator will open up in your browser.  
- Select a class you wish to plan a build for. If your selected class could AND have gone through the rebirth process, make sure to check the Reborn box.
- Adjust your base level and your stats, the Points Left field will be negative if you have spent more points than you could.  
- The numbers between parenthesis are the cost to raise its corresponding stat.

Known issues:  
- The adopted checkbox adjusts your caps to vanilla RO values. I don't know what NovaRO's caps are, if there are any.  
- The adopted checkbox isn't selectable if you are a transclass. I've been informed that you may be both a transclass and a baby character in NovaRO.
- You cannot adjust your job level, it's always set to the maximum. This is not an issue, it was done both for the sake of simplicity, and for a lack of data regarding when each stat gets raised. As such, this won't be "fixed".
- You cannot save your build. While it would be convenient, it's rather easy to just save a screenshot. I might add the feature later, if I ever get interested in learning how to save data locally, but as it is, there are no plans to implement such feature.

You're free to use my code, but you should credit me somewhere easily visible.  
Both the NovaRO logo and the background image do not belong to me, ask its respective owners before using it.
